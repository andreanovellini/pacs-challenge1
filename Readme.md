# Code to solve Cauchy problem #

This program computes the solution of the Cauchy problem dy(t)/dt = f(t,y) with initial condition y(t0)=u0 until final time T. In particular it considers f(t,y) = -t*exp(-y).

The program makes use of the theta-method to approximate the time derivative. Moreover it exploits the Newton method for the solution of the arising non-linear equation at each time step (the derivative of the non-linear function in the Newton method is approximated by centered finite differences).

The following parameters are taken in input from command line thanks to GetPot:
	1) theta = parameter of the theta-method;
	2) N = number of time steps; 
	3) t0 = initial time; 
	3) T = final time; 
	5) u0 = initial condition.

Example of execution: `./main N=150 theta=0.5 t0=0.0 T=1.0 u0=0.0`.
By default: N = 100, theta = 1 (Backward Euler scheme), t0 = 0.0, T = 1.0, u0 = 0.0.

In this directory, `make` produces the executable which is just called `main`.
The program is structured so that it will plot automatically the numeric solution, alongside the exact one, using GnuPlot and it can be run by calling the command `./main`.
